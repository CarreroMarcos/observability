# Observability Simulation Lab

Welcome to the Observability Simulation Lab! This repository serves as a hands-on educational environment designed to help users explore and practice concepts of observability in software systems. Whether you're new to observability or looking to deepen your skills, this lab provides practical scenarios for learning and experimentation.

## Features
- **Simulated Environment:** Realistic scenarios that mimic production environments.
- **Python-Based Implementation:** Uses Python functionalities to demonstrate observability techniques.
- **Experiential Learning:** Gain hands-on experience with logs, metrics, traces, and how they work together.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/CarreroMarcos/observability.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
