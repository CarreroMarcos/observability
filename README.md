# Observability Simulation Lab

This repository serves as a personal lab to explore and practice the principles of observability in software systems. It provides a Python-based, hands-on environment designed to simulate real-world scenarios.

## Features
- **Simulated Scenarios:** Examples designed to mimic production environments.
- **Python Implementation:** Focused on observability concepts and techniques within Python applications.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/CarreroMarcos/observability.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd observability
   ```
3. Install dependencies (if any):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Explore the simulation by running the provided Python scripts.

## Objectives
The primary focus of this lab is to facilitate:
- Understanding of observability fundamentals.
- Hands-on experimentation with logs, metrics, and traceability.

## Contributing
This is a personal lab and is not open for contributions at this time.
